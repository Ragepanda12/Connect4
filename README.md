###For the sake of I don't understand how eclipse works with git, i'm going to suggest that you just have a separate java file open from the git repository and copy that code into your eclipse, and then when you're done, copy the code from eclipse back into your java file in git before committing/pushing.

#### PSA: Use 4 space indents (NO TABS PLEASE)
